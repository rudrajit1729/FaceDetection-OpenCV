# FaceDetection-OpenCV
Face detection is a computer technology that is being applied for many different applications that require the identification of human faces in digital images or video. It can be regarded as a specific case of object-class detection, where the task is to find the locations and sizes of all objects in an image that belongs to a given class. The technology is able to detect frontal or near-frontal faces in a photo, regardless of orientation, lighting conditions or skin color.
